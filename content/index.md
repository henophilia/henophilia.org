This page is a rough draft outlining **Henophilia**, the verbalization of a culture embracing holistic well-being.

First and foremost, Henophilia is an intercultural, global **culture**: It strives to establish a common standard on **how we want to interact** and what constitutes high-quality, nuanced, reflected, enriching communication, no matter your background. Even though it is formulated in English for now, it strives to become universally understandable and applicable for all humans on earth. Various institutional, radically democratic, highly decentralized organizational structures will emanate from it over time.

Furthermore, Henophilia is a personal **life philosophy** and a **way of life**. Actually thinking and living according to it results in an incredibly fulfilling attitude towards life and leads to a deep sense of groundedness and the feeling of "arriving" in your personal peace of mind. It means embodying "A dream we dream together is reality".

Henophilia is also a special kind of **belief system**, but instead of seeing the divine as external (as it's the case in most religions, which then leads to authoritarianism and manipulation), it means that you see the **trust in your own creation** as divine and dogmatically believe in self-love and self-efficacy. This also means that Henophilia is **not a religion or a cult**, because it strongly distances itself from combining well-being with the centralization of power.

There will never be courses, retreats, organizations etc. solely dedicated to "learning Henophilia" or anything similar. Henophilia can only be felt through deep, compassionate, genuine friendship, both with yourself, with other people and with nature, combined with the intense excitement for life itself. At the same time, henophilia.org aims to provide links to associated projects, where practicing Henophilia might become easier, at the end of this page. After all, large-scale global transformations will be essential, as the large-scale transition to Henophilic Thought can be seen as humanity's most important task right now and the next major stage of human evolution. [Hermes' Loom](https://hermesloom.org) can be a starting point.

The term "Henophilia" (hen = unity, philia = love/friendship) does not claim any authority. This culture encourages individuals to find their own terms for it over the course of their own, personal journey towards flourishing. At its current stage, it does not possess a symbol, except for the word "Henophilia" itself.

[This](https://chatgpt.com/share/67490180-191c-8003-b515-2d344444c425) is quite a good summary of Henophilia in "explain like I'm five" style. The full original text, which sees itself both as a literary art piece and a rough theological-sociological-psychological comparison study, can be found [here](/original).
